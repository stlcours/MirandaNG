The plugin is intended to switch text layout in the input fileds (all text, selection or current word) (E.g. (EN->RU): Ghbdtn? rfr ltkf& - Привет, как дела?) or displaying "decoded" text from readonly fields (in logs of RTF, History++, IEView) using a popup with ability to copy result to clipboard. As of version 0.0.1.0 the ability to change register of symbols was added.
Keyboards layouts are arbitrary, their list is taken from system layouts. For text conversion configurational strings are used, which beginning from version 0.0.1.0 are generated by the plugin itself(!). The ability to edit this strings is temporary left in case of incorrect strings generation for layouts which weren't tested by author.
There is ability to define hotkeys for all above functions.

* Added ability to use alternative hotkey for text conversion.
* "Current word" mode is set for each hotkey, not globally.
* Added ability of two-way text conversion if system has 2 layouts. (E.g. (EN<->RU): Jgthfwbjyyfz cbcntvf Дштгч ckj;yf lkz hzljds[ гыук-jd - Операционная система Linux сложна для рядовых user-ов)
* Added ability to play sound on conversion (Options - Customize - Sounds)
* Added ability of "decoding" text for History++ log without entering the pseudo-edit mode of message (with ability to select several messages)
