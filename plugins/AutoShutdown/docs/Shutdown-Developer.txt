Services/Events
-----------------
	For more information about which service functions are offered by 
	'AutoShutdown' and about how they can be used by your plugin,
	please refer to 'm_shutdown.h'.

	Feel free to redirect any questions or extension ideas to me via e-mail:

Debug Symbols
-----------------
	Debug symbols are also available for debugging purposes.
	Copy the PDB-files in the SDK-zip into the same directory as the
	corresponding DLL-files.

	To debug crashes the supplied MAP-file file might be helpful.

Coding Language
-----------------
	'AutoShutdown' was written using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6
	and the Microsoft Platform SDK shipped along with it.

Rebase Info
-----------------
	'AutoShutdown' has set its base address to:
	0x11070000

	Please avoid using this base address for your plugins because it will
	slightly slow down startup of Miranda IM.

	With Microsoft Visual C++ the Base Address can be configured at:
	'Project' -> 'Settings' -> 'Linker' -> 'Output' -> 'Base Address'
