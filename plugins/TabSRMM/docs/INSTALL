
                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

 OS Requirements
------------------

For the UNICODE version, Windows 2000 or later is required. Windows XP or
later are the only supported platforms.

The x64 Version will require a 64bit Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 AND can
only work with a 64bit Miranda installation.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1) Copy the plugin DLL into your miranda plugins folder. 

2) Install the icon pack (see below).   

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the \icons folder. 
If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.
