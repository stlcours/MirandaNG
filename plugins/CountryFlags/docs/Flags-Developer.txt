	please refer to 'm_flags.h'.

Debug Symbols
-----------------
	Debug symbols are also available for debugging purposes.
	Copy the PDB-files in the SDK-zip into the same directory as the
	corresponding DLL-files.
	To debug crashes the supplied MAP-file file might be helpful.

Coding Language
-----------------
	'Country Flags' was written using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6
	and the Microsoft Platform SDK shipped along with it.

Rebase Info
-----------------
	'Country Flags' has set its base address to:
	0x24200000

	Please avoid using this base address for your plugins because it will
	slow down the startup of Miranda IM.

	Using Microsoft Visual C++, the base address can be configured at:
	'Project' -> 'Settings' -> 'Linker' -> 'Output' -> 'Base Address'
