- ignore global status change 
- only show contacts with protocols visibility (i.e if nimc is set to dnd then only contacts with dnd will be shown) and somehow an option to reverse this...
- a fwe other hidden options which no1 else but me knows about... :D
- hide the protocol status icon in the status menu.. (may as well c how hard it is to add...)

- never allow timer
