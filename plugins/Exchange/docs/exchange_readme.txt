Exchange mail notifier plugin v.0.0.3.3
Copyright © 2006-2009 Cristian Libotean, Attila Vajda

This plugin notifies you if you have unread emails on an exchange server.

You need to have an Exchange server present that accepts SMTP connections. You need to have Outlook
installed (mapi dll hell :) ) and a recent miranda version ( > 0.4).
You enter your email account, your password (you can leave this blank if you want - if you don't
enter it exchange will ask for your password and you'll have an option to remember it). Enter the
Exchange server ip or hostname and the port which accepts SMTP connections. The port is not needed
for the actual connection but it is needed in order to check that the server is available - if the server
is blocking the port you won't get notified as the plugin will think it can't connect to the server.
