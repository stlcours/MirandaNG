Description
-----------
This plugin for Miranda-IM notifies user of specified events (as incoming messages, incoming files, incoming URLs or other events). This plugin is based on the original one by Martin Öberg (aka strickz) and Std's modifications (mainly the idea of using direct port handling using a driver).

It has many options allowing:
  a) To select on which events to react
  b) Under which conditions (eg: fullscreen mode, ScreenSaver running, workstation locked)
  c) To act only if the protocol receiving the event is under specified status
  d) For message events you can choose to be notified if the message window is open or not
  e) A notification feature allowing to be notified of pending events (unopened events) after specified period of time
  f) To select method for stopping the blinking (after x secs, if Miranda is re-attended, if Windows is re-attended, if all notified events are opened or when the notify conditions end)
  g) And several flashing options: select leds to blink, effects (all at the same time, in turn, in sequence - left to right, right to left and left to right and to left again - and custom, preview button

It was designed to be flexible and performing different tasks. It can be configured to act like the original one and has several functions from other Miranda's keyboard notifier plugins.

It also provides services to allow third party plugins use its notifier capabilities and supports Trigger plugin.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USB KEYBOARD'S USERS: The plugin will only work if you choose to emulate keypresses (which is not the nicest solution but is the only way I found)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation
------------
Just the typical Miranda way: drop keyboardnotify.dll into your plugins folder, restart Miranda and configure the options as you like... voilà! done! NO OTHER FILES ARE REQUIRED.


Options
-------
Options page Options->Plugins->Keyboard Flash. Tabbed: Protocols, Rules (when), Flashing (how), Themes and Ignore.

Here there are some explanations on features on the Options' Page.

Protocols tab:
Protocols to check: check/uncheck the protocols you want this plugin to work with.

Rules tab:
Events to react on:
   - Incoming messages: check this if you want to be notified on incoming message events
   - Incoming files: check this if you want to be notified on incoming file events
   - Incoming URLs: check this if you want to be notified on incoming URL events
   - Everything else: check this if you want to be notified on incoming events that are not messages, files or URLs (like authorization requests or you-were-added events).
Message event only:
   - Blink if message window is open: check it if you want to be notified of incoming messages even if that contact's message window is open, if you uncheck it you will only be notified of incoming messages if the window is closed
   - ... and not in foreground: check this option if you want to be notified if the message window is open and that window is not focused
   - Only if last is xx seconds old: if you check this option the plugin will not notify you of new messages until xx seconds have passed after the last message for that contact was sent/received
Notify when:
   - Full screen mode: check this if you want to be notified when you are on full screen mode (screen saver excluded form the full screen classification, although it is a special type of full screen application)
   - Screen saver is running: check this if you want to be notified while screen saver is running
   - Workstation is locked (2000/XP): check this if you want to be notified when your workstation is locked (only for Windows NT systems)
   - Defined programs are running: check this one if you want to be notified when certain programs are running. To define those programs you have to click over the [...] button and enter the .exe filenames (including the .exe suffix).
   - All other situations: check this if you want to be notified when neither you are in full screen mode, nor the screen saver is running and nor the workstation is locked.
   Note on 'notify when': to be notified on ANY condition (always) you will have to check them all.
Notify if status is:
   - Online, Away, NA, etc: check each status for which you want notification to be turn on. Checking all means on all statuses.
   Note on 'notify if status is ...': The plugin will check these options against the event's protocol status, this means that if you choose to be notified only when you are online and at a certain moment you are online in one protocol but away in another, then you will be notified on events for the first one only.
Flash until:
   - nn seconds: if this option is selected leds will flash for the amount of seconds you have specified
   - Miranda/Windows is re-attended: if this option is selected flashing will stop when either the mouse or a key is pressed on any of Miranda/Windows's windows
   - Events are opened: if this option is selected flashing will stop when there will be no more pending events (for the selected protocols, of course)
   - End of 'notify when' conditions: if this option is selected the flashing will stop when all situations checked under 'notify when' (and also the status conditions) ceased to be true.
   Note on 'End of notify when conditions': this means that if you select ALL the 'notify when' situations and all the statuses (e.g. always) flashing will not stop (you may still stop it manually by pressing the Pause/Break key).
   This option is particluarly usuful if you want to be notified only when you are in full screen mode (for example) and you want the flashing to stop when you change to non full screen mode. The same applies to all the other situations.
Pending Events:
   - Remind me every xx minutes: this option will make the plugin check for unopen events every xx minutes and start notifying if any is found and the 'notify when' and the status conditions are met. If you don't want this option, just specify 0 minutes and it will be disabled.
   This option is usuful if you, for example, select to be notified on workstation locked and then to stop the flashing using 'end of notify conditions'. If you do not open the event that generated the flashing (e.g. leaving the event pending) then when you lock your computer back the flashing will begin again.
   Note that if on your messaging plugin you have enabled the option to pop up the message window, then the reminder won't alert you of messages (as they will be promptly opened) but it will still work for files/URLs/others.

Flashing tab:
Keys to flash:
   - Num Lock: check this if you want the Num Lock led to blink
   - Caps Lock: check this if you want the Caps Lock led to blink
   - Scroll Lock: check this if you want the Scroll Lock led to blink.
   Note on 'keys to flash': if you don't choose any you will see nothing happen.
Flashing effects:
   - All at the same time: if you select this one the leds will blink at the same time
   - In turn: if you select this one the leds will blink this way: Num+Scroll first and then Caps if the three of them are selected in 'keys to flash', if not they will blink alternately
   - In sequence: if you select this one leds will blink one at the time in sequence; the order of the sequence depends on:
        - left->right: from left to right
        - right->left: from right to left
        - left<->right: from left to right and then right to left (producing the infamous KITT effect)
   - Custom theme: if you select this one you will have to select from the combo box one of the themes you have created in the "Themes" tab. For more information refer to the 'Themes tabs' explanation
   - Accordingly to events' count: if you select this option the plugin will flash the num lock led as many times as pending message events there will be, the same for caps lock and file events, scroll lock and urls events and the three at the same time and other events.
     Since v.1.5.3.2 you can use the [...] button to open the dialog that allows you to change the default leds assign to each event.
   Note on 'flashing effects': effects will take into consideration the 'keys to flash' options, which means that only the checked leds will blink. In the case of custom flashing sequences (themes), the plugin will show no led turned on if you specify one led (or a combination of leds) that is not selected in 'keys to flash'.
Wait before starting flashing:
   - nn seconds: specify the amount of time for the plugin to wait before starting flashing (0 means do not wait).
Speed: You may select between 5 different speeds that go from really slow to really fast.
Preview button: This button will allow you to test your flashing settings. Since v.1.5.3.3 it is an on/off button (thank you tweety for the definition), which means that it will flash when it is on and stop when it is off.
Note on preview button: the preview button will show nothing at all when you select the "Accordingly to events' count' flashing effect: as most probably there will be no pending event it will just turn off your leds (it has really nothing to show).
Emulate keypresses: if you check this option the plugin will act as if keystrokes were sent from the keyboard, which means that some nasty things may happen, as toggling on and off capital letters or being kicked from Windows' screensaver. It is meant only for people having trouble with the other method (ie people using USB keyboards).

Themes tab:
Create/Edit theme:
   - In the 'Theme' combo box you type the name of the new theme you want to add or you select from the dropdown list the one you want to modify or delete.
   - In the text box you specify a flashing sequence in the form of an expression in a special 'flashing language' created by me (to take a look at the specification of this 'language' please refer to next section: 'Custom order language').
   - Test button: use this one to see how the sequence in the text box will actualy look in action.
   Note on the test button: this button and the preview button act differently (and don't expect the 'Preview' to act like this one, as its function is completely different). First, this one will show you how the sequence will look without taking into consideration options in the 'flashing tab' (like 'keys to flash', 'wait delay', but it will use the 'speed' setting). This test button will finish playing the sequence after showing it twice and at least for 2 seconds (both conditions). This behaviour, I think, will work fine for almost any user but if you think you need to change that (say, making it flash for 3 seconds or 4 times) there is a way if you change two settings stored in the DB using DBEditor++: you have to change the values of "testnum" and/or "testsecs", both of the 'byte' type (the first one rules the x times condition and the second the x seconds one). I did not put these options in the Option page just because I don't like the idea of a control to control another control (superstition?); I find it confusing.
    - Add/Update/Delete: these buttons will either add a new theme, update and delete an existing one. 'Add' will be enabled only if you type a new theme name in the theme combo box. 'Update' will be enabled if you have modified the flashing sequence for an existing theme. 'Delete' will be enabled if the theme currently selected is an existing one (e.g., not a new one that has not been added yet). After pressing any of these buttons the 'Apply' button will be automatically enabled. This means that changes will be saved in the database only after activating the 'Apply' button.
Import/Export:
    - Export: it will export the themes stored in the DB to a text file with the .knt extension (keyboard Notify Theme).
    - Import: it will load into the option page the themes specified in a text file with the .knt extension (the file, obviously, has the same format that the export one). Themes will be stored only after clicking on the 'Aply' button (just like the add/update/delete buttons).
    - Override existing: check this option if you want existing themes (it checks by theme name) to be overwritten when you import them. If you don't check this option existing themes will not be overwritten.
Note on Import/Export: I packed my own themes file to show you the file format (mythemes.knt). Most of the themes are the creation of Sir_Qwerty (thank you very much *g*), the boring ones are mine.


Custom order 'language'
-----------------------
I designed a special 'flashing language' in order to allow users to provide the plugin with the flashing sequence. Here is an explanation of which symbols it uses and what they mean:
1: turn on Num Lock led
2: turn on Caps Lock led
3: turn on Scroll Lock led
0: turn all leds off
[...]: turn on at the same time the leds specified inside the brackets (1, 2, 3)
This is the complete list of symbols. Any other will be ignored by the plugin parser (and cleaned from the text box).
And here you have some examples of how the predefined effects should look in this 'language':
All at the same time: [123]0
In turn: [13]2
In sequence (left->right): 123
In sequence (right->left): 321
In sequence (left<->right) 1232
Turn on all leds without blinking: [123]
Sliding lights: [12]30[23]10
Heartbeat (created by sir_qwerty): 00000000000000000000000000000000303
Note: remember that when the sequence is finished the plugin will go back to the beginning until it has to stop due to 'until when' settings.
