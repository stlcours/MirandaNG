This is a slightly modified version of the original sndVol plugin which 
was written by Std.

The following things have changed:
----------------------------------

* added ability to set the volume for the mRadio plugin (if installed).
  (this is optional, you can still use sndVol for ONLY setting the volume
  for event sounds and handle mRadio volume directly in mRadio).
  
* added ability to mute mRadio when muting event sounds (again, optional.)

* added 2 items to the option page to allow enabling the features above 
  (mRadio support).
  
* added ability to change background colour of the sndVol frame.

* added 2nd mute button to mute mRadio ONLY (event sounds will stay 
  unmuted). This button is only visible when the mRadio plugin is 
  installed and detected. The 2 buttons may be synced when the option
  "mute mRadio" on the options page is enabled, so it is still possible
  to mute both event sounds and radio with a single click.

* UPDATED FOR Miranda 0.8.x.x or later.
  
  You can also right-click this button to open mRadio settings.
