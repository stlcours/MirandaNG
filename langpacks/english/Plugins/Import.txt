[Choose how you would like to import:]
[From a Miranda NG database.]
[This wizard will help you import contacts and message history from another Miranda profile or from an external program.]
[It is recommended that you create a backup of your current Miranda profile before importing.]
[You will probably never need to use this wizard again, so you can save memory by not loading it every time you start Miranda. This will mean that the import menu item will no longer be available.]
[Do not load the import plugin at startup again]
[Import completed]
[If at a future date you wish to use the wizard again, you can make it load again by going to the Plugins section of the Options dialog box.]
[Miranda has found Miranda profiles with the following names. Please select the one you wish to import, or click "Other Profile" if your profile is not listed, or if the list is empty.]
