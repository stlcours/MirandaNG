[Are you sure you want to reload all messages for all contacts from vk.com?\nLocal contact history will be deleted and reloaded from the server.\nIt may take a very long time and/or corrupt Miranda database.\nWe recommend check your database before reloading messages and after it (Miranda32.exe /svc:dbchecker or Miranda64.exe /svc:dbchecker).\nDo you want to continue?]
