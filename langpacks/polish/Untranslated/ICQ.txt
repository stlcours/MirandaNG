[The server did not respond to the connection attempt within a reasonable time, it may be temporarily down. Try again later.]
[Miranda was unable to resolve the name of a server to its numeric address.

[Your proxy rejected the user name and password that you provided. Please check them in M->Options->Network.]
[The server to which you are trying to connect does not exist. Check your spelling in M->Options->Network->ICQ.]
