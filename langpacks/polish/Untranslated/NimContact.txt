[Non-IM Contact allows you to add 'contacts' that can act as shortcuts to other programs, or links to web pages.\r\nThe contacts name can be read from a text file (includes any ASCII file).\r\nThis plugin is a combination of Favorites and Text Reader plugins both made by me)]

[String replacing variables....\r\nThe following are all the valid variables that can be used. Refer to the readme for a proper explanation.\r\n\r\n]
[file(X)\t\t<- specifies the file to read from\r\nMUST be followed by either start() or end() or wholeline()\r\n]
[filename(X)\t\t<- copyies the filename of file X.\r\n]
[start(...)\t\t<-specifies where to start copying from.\r\n]
[end(...)\t\t<-specifies where to stop copying.\r\n]
[wholeline(line(...))\t<-specifies a whole line to copy\r\n\r\n]
[start() and end() explained\r\n.........................\r\n]
[MUST start with line() followed by a number or a string inside " marks, OR csv(seperatorX) variable\r\n]
[The number specifies which character in the line to start/end copying.\r\nThe string specifies a string in the line to start/end copying.\r\n]
[csv(seperatorX) explained...\r\nseperator is either "tab" or "space" or any SINGLE character.\r\nX is the Xth seperator to pass before copying, (or to stop before)\r\n\r\n]
[Lastly the line(...) variable...\r\n]
[Inside the brackets must be either a number (to specify the line number), or a string inside " marks (to use the line with that string), or lastline(X).\r\nthe X in lastline is the Xth line above the last line. i.e lastline(1) will use the 2nd last line of the file.\r\n]
[If searching for a line with u may put a + or - X after the closing ) i.e line("some words\]
[Some Expamples...\r\n\r\n]
[filename(0)     <- will display the filename of the 0th file\r\nfile(0)wholeline(line(0))) <- will display the whole first line of the 0th file\r\nfile(0)wholeline(line("hello\]
