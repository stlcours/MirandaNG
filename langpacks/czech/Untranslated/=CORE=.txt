[The 'MetaContacts Hidden Group' has been added to your contact list.\nThis is most likely due to server-side contact information. To fix this, so that\nMetaContacts continues to function correctly, you should:\n   - disable MetaContacts using the 'Toggle MetaContacts Off' main menu item\n   - move all contacts out of this group\n   - synchronize your contacts with the server\n   - re-enable MetaContacts]
