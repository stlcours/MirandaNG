;[If you add a mod of a Xfire supported game, then you can specify what gameid will be sent to Xfire. So if you add a Half-Life mod, you can set the Half-Life game id and if you start the game, your Xfire buddies will see the Half-Life game icon next to your name and the game time will be tracked.]
