[Allows you to manage database settings.\nUsage:\n db set <module> <name> (b|i|d|s|w)<value>\n  db delete <module> <name>\n  db get <module> <name>.\nThe command can set a database entry to the specified value (if the entry does not exist it will be created) as well as read or delete a specified database entry. <Module> is the name of the module where the key should be located, <name> is the name of the key and <value> is the value to be written. A character must be placed before <value> in order to specify what kind of data to write: b - byte, i - integer (word), d - double word, s - string, w - wide string.]
[Configures proxy settings either globally or per account.\nUsage: proxy (global|<account>) <setting> [<params>].\n  <setting> is one of the following settings:\n    status (disable | enable | toggle).\n    server <proxy type> <server> <port>]
[Allows you to search/list contacts or open a message windows for specified contacts.\nUsage:\n contacts list [<keyword> [account:<account>] [id:<id>] [status:<status>] [<keyword> [...]]]. The command will search all contacts and display the ones matching the search criteria. To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain id use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'.\n contacts open [<keyword> [account:<account>] [id:<id>] [status:<status>] [<keyword> [...]]]. The command will open a message window for all contacts that match the search criteria. To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain id use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'. If no keyword is specified the command will open a message window for all contacts that have unread messages.]
[Shows history or unread messages for a contact.\nUsage:\n history <command> <contact>.\n <command> is one of the following commands:\n    unread - show unread messages for that contact.\n    show <contact> <start> <finish> - show history from event number <start> to <finish>. If any number is negative it is interpreted as a relative index from the last event number + 1 (so the last event for a contact is -1).]
[Shows version information for Miranda and CmdLine plugin. If VersionInfo plugin is installed it will use its report instead.\nUsage:\n version. The command will print Miranda's and CmdLine's version numbers or, if VersionInfo plugin is installed, it will show VersionInfo's report.]
[Changes the user's nickname on the given protocol to the new name.\nUsage:\n setnickname <protocol> new_nickname]
[Ignores or removes ignore flags for specific contacts.\nUsage:\n ignore (block | unblock) <contact> [<contact> [<contact> [..]]]. Ignores or removes ignore flags for the specified contacts.]

[Changes not saved]
[Don't forget to click on Apply to save the changes. If you don't then the changes won't]
[be saved to the database, they will only be valid for this session.]
[Variable string]
[What it expands to:]
[Expands to your miranda path (e.g: c:\\program files\\miranda ng).]
[Expands to your profile path - the value found in mirandaboot.ini,]
[ProfileDir section (usually inside miranda's folder).]
[Expands to your current profile name without the extenstion.]
[(e.g.default if your your profile is default.dat).]
[Environment variables]
[The plugin can also expand environment variables; the variables are specified like in any other]
[program that can use environment variables, i.e. %<env variable>%.]
[Note: Environment variables are expanded before any Miranda variables. So if you have, for]
[example, %profile_path% defined as a system variable then it will be expanded to that value]
[instead of expanding to Miranda's profile path.]
[Examples:]
[If the value for the ProfileDir inside mirandaboot.ini, ProfileDir section is '.\\profiles\', current]
[profile is 'default.dat' and miranda's path is 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\' then:]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles']
[will expand to 'default']
[will expand to the temp folder of the current user.]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles\\default']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\plugins\\config']
[Notice that the spaces at the beginning and the end of the string are trimmed, as well as the last.]

[Please enter your input below]
[Don't set a contact]
[Set to the following contact]
[The token %subject% is translated into a special contact, which depends on the situation in which the string is parsed. Use this dialog to simulate the contact to which %subject% translates. An example for using this token is: !cinfo(%subject%,display).]
[The token %extratext% is translated into a string which depends on the situation in which the string is parsed. Use this dialog to simulate the string to which %extratext% translates.]
[The Variables plugin translates various tokens into a certain value. An example is: I'm running Miranda %mirandaversion%. The substring %mirandaversion% will be translated into the correct version number. The following list shows all available tokens.]
[Token]
[--- Special characters ---\r\n\r\nThe following characters have a special meaning in a formatting string:\r\n\r\n?<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will be parsed again. Example: Today is ?cdate(yyyy/MM/dd).\r\n\r\n!<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will not be parsed again. Example: Message waiting: !message(,first,rcvd,unread).\r\n\r\n%<field>%\r\nThis will parse the given field. Example: I installed Miranda at: %mirandapath%.\r\n\r\n`<string>`\r\nThis will not parse the given string, any function, field or special character in the string will shown in the result without being translated. Example: Use `%mirandapath%` to show the installation path.\r\n\r\n#<comment>\r\nThis will add a comment in the formatting string. Everything from the # character to the end of the line will be removed. Example: %dbprofile% #this is a useless comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Contacts ---\r\n\r\nWhenever a functions requires a contact as an argument, you can specify it in two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) Using a unique id (UIN for ICQ, email for MSN) or, a protocol id followed by a unique id in the form <PROTOID:UNIQUEID>, for example <MSN:miranda@hotmail.com> or <ICQ:123456789>.\r\n\r\n(2) Using the contact function:\r\n?contact(x,y)\r\nA contact will be searched which will have value x for its property y, y can be one of the following:\r\nfirst, last, nick, email, id or display\r\n\r\nFor example: ?contact(miranda@hotmail.com,email) or ?contact(Miranda,nick). The contact function will return either a unique contact according to the arguments or nothing if none or multiple contacts exists with the given property.]
