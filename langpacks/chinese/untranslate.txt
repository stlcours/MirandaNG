[Allows plugins to save their data to user selected folders; supports variables.]
[Don't forget to click on Apply to save the changes. If you don't then the changes won't]
[be saved to the database, they will only be valid for this session.]
[Variable string]
[What it expands to:]
[Expands to your miranda path (e.g: c:\\program files\\miranda ng).]
[Expands to your profile path - the value found in mirandaboot.ini,]
[ProfileDir section (usually inside miranda's folder).]
[Expands to your current profile name without the extenstion.]
[(e.g.default if your your profile is default.dat).]
[Environment variables]
[The plugin can also expand environment variables; the variables are specified like in any other]
[program that can use environment variables, i.e. %<env variable>%.]
[Note: Environment variables are expanded before any Miranda variables. So if you have, for]
[example, %profile_path% defined as a system variable then it will be expanded to that value]
[instead of expanding to Miranda's profile path.]
[Examples:]
[If the value for the ProfileDir inside mirandaboot.ini, ProfileDir section is '.\\profiles\', current]
[profile is 'default.dat' and miranda's path is 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\' then:]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles']
[will expand to 'default']
[will expand to the temp folder of the current user.]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles\\default']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\plugins\\config']
[Notice that the spaces at the beginning and the end of the string are trimmed, as well as the last.]

Example: Today is ?cdate(yyyy/MM/dd).\r\n\r\n!<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will not be parsed again. Example: Message waiting: !message(,first,rcvd,unread).\r\n\r\n%<field>%\r\nThis will parse the given field. Example: I installed Miranda at: %mirandapath%.\r\n\r\n`<string>`\r\nThis will not parse the given string, any function, field or special character in the string will shown in the result without being translated. Example: Use `%mirandapath%` to show the installation path.\r\n\r\n#<comment>\r\nThis will add a comment in the formatting string. Everything from the # character to the end of the line will be removed. Example: %dbprofile% #this is a useless comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Contacts ---\r\n\r\nWhenever a functions requires a contact as an argument, you can specify it in two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) Using a unique id (UIN for ICQ, email for MSN) or, a protocol id followed by a unique id in the form <PROTOID:UNIQUEID>, for example <MSN:miranda@hotmail.com> or <ICQ:123456789>.\r\n\r\n(2) Using the contact function:\r\n?contact(x,y)\r\nA contact will be searched which will have value x for its property y, y can be one of the following:\r\nfirst, last, nick, email, id or display\r\n\r\nFor example: ?contact(miranda@hotmail.com,email) or ?contact(Miranda,nick). The contact function will return either a unique contact according to the arguments or nothing if none or multiple contacts exists with the given property.]

[If you add a mod of a Xfire supported game, then you can specify what gameid will be sent to Xfire. So if you add a Half-Life mod, you can set the Half-Life game id and if you start the game, your Xfire buddies will see the Half-Life game icon next to your name and the game time will be tracked.]
[Every game in Xfire needs an id. Use a number above the last used id to avoid problems with used ids. Every number above 10000 should be save. This id will not be sent to Xfire, when you start a game.]
