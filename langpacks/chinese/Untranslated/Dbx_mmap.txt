[Total]
[Only critical data are encrypted (passwords, security tokens etc). All another settings and history remains unencrypted. Fast and effective, suitable for the most cases]
[All string settings and all events in histories are encrypted. It also makes Miranda much slower and creates a risk of loosing everything you've stored in a profile in case of loosing password. Recommended only for paranoidal users]
[Miranda has detected corruption in your database. This corruption maybe fixed by DbChecker plugin. Please download it from http://miranda-ng.org/p/DbChecker/. Miranda will now shutdown.]
