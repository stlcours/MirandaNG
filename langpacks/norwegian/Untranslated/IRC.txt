[Faster! Searches the network for an exact match of the nickname only. The hostmask is optional and provides further security if used. Wildcards (? and *) are allowed.]
[Slower! Searches the network for nicknames matching a wildcard string. The hostmask is mandatory and a minimum of 4 characters is necessary in the "Nick" field. Wildcards (? and *) are allowed.]
