[Notifies Exchange plugin to check for email.\nUsage: exchange check]
[Notifies YAMN plugin to check for email.\nUsage: yamn check.]
[Calls a Miranda service.\nUsage: callservice <service> (d|s)<wParam> (d|s)<lParam>. The command will call Miranda <service> service using wParam and lParam as arguments; the first letter of the paramater must be either 'd' if the parameter is a decimal number or 's' if the parameter is a string. Be careful when you use this function as you can only pass numbers and strings as data.\nNOTE:If you pass invalid data to a service Miranda might crash.]
[Sends a message to the specified contact(s).\nUsage: message <contact> [<contact> [<contact> [...]]] <message>. The command will send <message> to the specified contact(s) - at least one contact must be specified - all parameters except the last one are considered recipients.\n<Contact> has the following format:<name>[:<account>]. <Name> is the contact display name or unique ID and <account> is an optional parameter representing the account of the contact (useful in case there is more than one contact with the same name).\nNOTE:The message string cannot exceed 512 characters.]
[Allows you to manage database settings.\nUsage:\n db set <module> <name> (b|i|d|s|w)<value>\n  db delete <module> <name>\n  db get <module> <name>.\nThe command can set a database entry to the specified value (if the entry does not exist it will be created) as well as read or delete a specified database entry. <Module> is the name of the module where the key should be located, <name> is the name of the key and <value> is the value to be written. A character must be placed before <value> in order to specify what kind of data to write: b - byte, i - integer (word), d - double word, s - string, w - wide string.]

[Allows you to search/list contacts or open a message windows for specified contacts.\nUsage:\n contacts list [<keyword> [account:<account>] [id:<id>] [status:<status>] [<keyword> [...]]]. The command will search all contacts and display the ones matching the search criteria. To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain id use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'.\n contacts open [<keyword> [account:<account>] [id:<id>] [status:<status>] [<keyword> [...]]]. The command will open a message window for all contacts that match the search criteria. To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain id use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'. If no keyword is specified the command will open a message window for all contacts that have unread messages.]
[Shows history or unread messages for a contact.\nUsage:\n history <command> <contact>.\n <command> is one of the following commands:\n    unread - show unread messages for that contact.\n    show <contact> <start> <finish> - show history from event number <start> to <finish>. If any number is negative it is interpreted as a relative index from the last event number + 1 (so the last event for a contact is -1).]
[Shows version information for Miranda and CmdLine plugin. If VersionInfo plugin is installed it will use its report instead.\nUsage:\n version. The command will print Miranda's and CmdLine's version numbers or, if VersionInfo plugin is installed, it will show VersionInfo's report.]

[Allows plugins to save their data to user selected folders; supports variables.]
[Don't forget to click on Apply to save the changes. If you don't then the changes won't]
[be saved to the database, they will only be valid for this session.]
[Variable string]
[What it expands to:]
[Expands to your miranda path (e.g: c:\\program files\\miranda ng).]
[Expands to your profile path - the value found in mirandaboot.ini,]
[ProfileDir section (usually inside miranda's folder).]
[Expands to your current profile name without the extenstion.]
[(e.g.default if your your profile is default.dat).]
[Environment variables]
[The plugin can also expand environment variables; the variables are specified like in any other]
[program that can use environment variables, i.e. %<env variable>%.]
[Note: Environment variables are expanded before any Miranda variables. So if you have, for]
[example, %profile_path% defined as a system variable then it will be expanded to that value]
[instead of expanding to Miranda's profile path.]
[Examples:]
[If the value for the ProfileDir inside mirandaboot.ini, ProfileDir section is '.\\profiles\', current]
[profile is 'default.dat' and miranda's path is 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\' then:]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles']
[will expand to 'default']
[will expand to the temp folder of the current user.]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles\\default']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\plugins\\config']
[Notice that the spaces at the beginning and the end of the string are trimmed, as well as the last.]
