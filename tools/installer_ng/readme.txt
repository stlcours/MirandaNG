      How to compile Miranda NG installer:


1. Run make_all.bat (will download, compile and cleanup all) or make_interactive.bat for user interactive mode.

2. Collect the compiled installer files from Output folder.

3. Optionally run cleanup.bat if you want to delete all the temporary files and build folders (if make_all.bat didn't do it for you already).
