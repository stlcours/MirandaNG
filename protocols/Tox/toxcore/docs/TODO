TODO list.

[IN PROGRESS] Add what is left to do to the TODO list.

Networking:
    [NOT STARTED] UPnP port forwarding.
    [NOT STARTED] NAT-PMP port forwarding.

DHT:
    [ALMOST DONE] Metadata collection prevention. (docs/Prevent_Tracking.txt)
    [IN PROGRESS] Hardening against attacks.
    [IN PROGRESS] Optimizing the code.

Lossless UDP:
    [DONE] Increase data send/receive rates.

[IN PROGRESS] Massive IRC like group chats (text only)
    [DONE] Networking base.
    [NOT STARTED] Syncing chat state between clients (nicknames, list of who is in chat, etc...)
    [NOT STARTED] Make clients sign their messages so that peers can't modify them.

[IN PROGRESS] Audio/Video
    [DONE] encoding/streaming/decoding
    [DONE] Call initiation
    [DONE] Encryption
    [IN PROGRESS] Auditing.
    [NEEDS TESTING] Video packet splitting.
    [IN PROGRESS] Prevent audio skew (seems to be easily solvable client side.)
    [IN PROGRESS] Group chats.

Friend_requests.c:
    [NOT STARTED] What happens when a friend request is received needs to be changed.
    [NOT STARTED] Add multiple nospam functionality.

[DONE] File transfers
[NOT STARTED] Offline messaging
[NOT STARTED] Friends list syncing
[IN PROGRESS] IPV6 support
    [DONE] Networking
    [DONE] DHT + Messenger
    [NOT STARTED] Group chats (They work with IPv6 but some things need to be tested.)


[IN PROGRESS] Make toxcore thread safe.

[NOT STARTED] Make the core save/datafile portable across client versions/different processor architectures.

[MOSTLY DONE] A way for people to connect to people on Tox if they are behind a bad NAT that 
blocks UDP (or is just unpunchable) (docs/TCP_Network.txt)

[NEEDS TESTING] Make the save made with tox_save_encrypted(...) harder to brute force.
